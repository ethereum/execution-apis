# Authentication

The `engine` JSON-RPC interface, exposed by execution layer clients and consumed by consensus layer clients, needs to be authenticated. The authentication scheme chosen for this purpose is [JWT](https://jwt.io/).

The type of attacks that this authentication scheme attempts to protect against are the following:

- RPC port exposed towards the internet, allowing attackers to exchange messages with execution layer engine API.
- RPC port exposed towards the browser, allowing malicious webpages to submit messages to the execution layer engine API.

The authentication scheme is _not_ designed to

- Prevent attackers with capability to read ('sniff') network traffic from reading the traffic,
- Prevent attackers with capability to read ('sniff') network traffic from performing replay-attacks of earlier messages.

Authentication is performed as follows:

- For `HTTP` dialogue, each `jsonrpc` request is individually authenticated by supplying `JWT` token in the HTTP header.
- For a WebSocket dialogue, only the initial handshake is authenticated, after which the message dialogue proceeds without further use of JWT.
  - Clarification: The websocket handshake starts with the consensus layer client performing a websocket upgrade request. This is a regular http GET request, and the actual
parameters for the WS-handshake are carried in the http headers.
- For `inproc`, a.k.a raw ipc communication, no authentication is required, under the assumption that a process able to access `ipc` channels for the process, which usually means local file access, is already sufficiently permissioned that further authentication requirements do not add security.


## JWT specifications

- The execution layer client **MUST** expose the authenticated Engine API at a port independent from existing JSON-RPC API.
  - The default port for the authenticated Engine API is `8551`. The Engine API is exposed under the `engine` namespace.
- The execution layer client **MUST** support at least the following `alg` `HMAC + SHA256` (`HS256`)
- The execution layer client **MUST** reject the `alg` `none`.


The HMAC algorithm implies that several consensus layer clients will be able to use the same key, and from an authentication perspective, be able to impersonate each other. From a deployment perspective, it means that an EL does not need to be provisioned with individual keys for each consensus layer client.

## Key distribution

The execution layer and consensus layer clients **SHOULD** accept a configuration parameter: `jwt-secret`, which designates a file containing the hex-encoded 256 bit secret key to be used for verifying/generating JWT tokens.

If such a parameter _is_ given, but the file cannot be read, or does not contain a hex-encoded key of `256` bits, the client **SHOULD** treat this as an error: either abort the startup, or show error and continue without exposing the authenticated port.

If such a parameter _is not_ given, the client **MUST** attempt to read the secret from the default paths defined below, in the order they are listed. If a secret is found, but the file cannot be read, does not contain a hex-encoded key of `256` bit, or is rejected by the other client, the client **MUST** continue searching until all default paths are exhausted. Consensus layer clients **MAY** search other locations, such as execution layer client data directories.

If no existing JWT is located, the client **SHOULD** generate such a token, valid for the duration of the execution, and store the hex-encoded secret on the filesystem. The exact path is dependant on the host OS, see the default paths below. If the client is unable to write the secret to an OS-specific path, it **MUST** fallback to writing to its own data directory.

### Default JWT secret locations

For Linux:
* `$XDG_CACHE_DIR/ethereum/engine/jwt.hex`
* `$HOME/.cache/ethereum/engine/jwt.hex`

For Mac:
* `$HOME/Library/Caches/Ethereum/Engine/jwt.hex`

For Windows:
* `%LocalAppData%/Ethereum/Engine/jwt.hex`

## JWT Claims

This specification utilizes the following list of JWT claims:

- Required: `iat` (issued-at) claim. The execution layer client **SHOULD** only accept `iat` timestamps which are within +-60 seconds from the current time.
- Optional: `id` claim. The consensus layer client **MAY** use this to communicate a unique identifier for the individual consensus layer client.
- Optional: `clv` claim. The consensus layer client **MAY** use this to communicate the consensus layer client type/version.

Other claims **MAY** be included in the JWT payload. If the execution layer client sees claims it does not recognize, these **MUST** be ignored.
