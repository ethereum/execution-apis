## Structures

### WithdrawalV1

This structure maps onto the validator withdrawal object from the beacon chain spec.
The fields are encoded as follows:

- `index`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `validatorIndex`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `address`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes
- `amount`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits

*Note*: the `amount` value is represented on the beacon chain as a little-endian value in units of Gwei, whereas the
`amount` in this structure *MUST* be converted to a big-endian value in units of Gwei.

### ExecutionPayloadV2

This structure has the syntax of `ExecutionPayloadV1` and appends a single field: `withdrawals`.

- `parentHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `feeRecipient`:  `DATA`, 20 Bytes
- `stateRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `receiptsRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `logsBloom`: `DATA`, 256 Bytes
- `prevRandao`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `gasLimit`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `gasUsed`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `extraData`: `DATA`, 0 to 32 Bytes
- `baseFeePerGas`: `QUANTITY`, 256 Bits
- `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `transactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.

### ExecutionPayloadBodyV1
This structure contains a body of an execution payload. The fields are encoded as follows:
- `transactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.

### PayloadAttributesV2

This structure has the syntax of `PayloadAttributesV1` and appends a single field: `withdrawals`.

- `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits - value for the `timestamp` field of the new payload
- `prevRandao`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - value for the `prevRandao` field of the new payload
- `suggestedFeeRecipient`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - suggested value for the `feeRecipient` field of the new payload
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.

* params:
  1. `forkchoiceState`: `Object` - instance of [`ForkchoiceStateV1`](./paris.md#ForkchoiceStateV1)
  2. `payloadAttributes`: `Object|null` - instance of [`PayloadAttributesV1`](./paris.md#PayloadAttributesV1) | [`PayloadAttributesV2`](#PayloadAttributesV2) or `null`, where:
      - `PayloadAttributesV1` **MUST** be used to build a payload with the `timestamp` value lower than the Shanghai timestamp,
      - `PayloadAttributesV2` **MUST** be used to build a payload with the `timestamp` value greater or equal to the Shanghai timestamp,
      - Client software **MUST** return `-32602: Invalid params` error if the wrong version of the structure is used in the method call.
* timeout: 8s

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1`](./paris.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv1) with the exception of the following:

1. Client software **MAY NOT** validate terminal PoW block conditions in the following places:
    - during payload validation (point (2) in the [Payload validation](./paris.md#payload-validation) routine specification),
    - when updating the forkchoice state (point (3) in the [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1`](./paris.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv1) method specification).
2. Consensus layer client **MUST** call this method instead of `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` under any of the following conditions:
    - `headBlockHash` references a block which `timestamp` is greater or equal to the Shanghai timestamp,
    - `payloadAttributes` is not `null` and `payloadAttributes.timestamp` is greater or equal to the Shanghai timestamp.

* params:
  1. `payloadId`: `DATA`, 8 Bytes - Identifier of the payload build process
* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `object`
  - `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV1`](./paris.md#ExecutionPayloadV1) | [`ExecutionPayloadV2`](#ExecutionPayloadV2) where:
      - `ExecutionPayloadV1` **MUST** be returned if the payload `timestamp` is lower than the Shanghai timestamp
      - `ExecutionPayloadV2` **MUST** be returned if the payload `timestamp` is greater or equal to the Shanghai timestamp
  - `blockValue` : `QUANTITY`, 256 Bits - The expected value to be received by the `feeRecipient` in wei
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the payload.

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_getPayloadV1`](./paris.md#engine_getpayloadv1) with the addition of the following:

  1. Client software **SHOULD** use the sum of the block's priority fees or any other algorithm to determine `blockValue`.

### engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1

#### Request

* method: `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1`
* params:
  1. `Array of DATA`, 32 Bytes - Array of `block_hash` field values of the `ExecutionPayload` structure
* timeout: 10s

#### Response

* result: `Array of ExecutionPayloadBodyV1` - Array of [`ExecutionPayloadBodyV1`](#ExecutionPayloadBodyV1) objects.
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while processing the method call.

#### Specification

1. Given array of block hashes client software **MUST** respond with array of `ExecutionPayloadBodyV1` objects with the corresponding hashes respecting the order of block hashes in the input array.

1. Client software **MUST** place responses in the order given in the request, using `null` for any missing blocks. For instance, if the request is `[A.block_hash, B.block_hash, C.block_hash]` and client software has data of payloads `A` and `C`, but doesn't have data of `B`, the response **MUST** be `[A.body, null, C.body]`.

1. Client software **MUST** support request sizes of at least 32 block hashes. The call **MUST** return `-38004: Too large request` error if the number of requested payload bodies is too large.

1. Client software **MAY NOT** respond to requests for finalized blocks by hash.

1. Client software **MUST** set `withdrawals` field to `null` for bodies of pre-Shanghai blocks.

1. This request maps to [`BeaconBlocksByRoot`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#beaconblocksbyroot) in the consensus layer `p2p` specification. Callers must be careful to use the execution block hash, instead of the beacon block root.

1. Callers must consider that syncing execution layer client may not serve any block bodies, including those that were supplied by `engine_newPayload` calls.

### engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1

#### Request

* method: `engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1`
* params:
  1. `start`: `QUANTITY`, 64 bits - Starting block number
  1. `count`: `QUANTITY`, 64 bits - Number of blocks to return
* timeout: 10s

#### Response

* result: `Array of ExecutionPayloadBodyV1` - Array of [`ExecutionPayloadBodyV1`](#ExecutionPayloadBodyV1) objects.
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while processing the method call.

#### Specification

1. Given a `start` and a `count`, the client software **MUST** respond with array of `ExecutionPayloadBodyV1` objects with the corresponding execution block number respecting the order of blocks in the canonical chain, as selected by the latest `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` call.

1. Client software **MUST** support `count` values of at least 32 blocks. The call **MUST** return `-38004: Too large request` error if the requested range is too large.

1. Client software **MUST** return `-32602: Invalid params` error if either `start` or `count` value is less than `1`.

1. Client software **MUST** place `null` in the response array for unavailable blocks which numbers are lower than a number of the latest known block. Client software **MUST NOT** return trailing `null` values if the request extends past the current latest known block. Execution Layer client software is expected to download and carry the full block history until EIP-4444 or a similar proposal takes into effect. Consider the following response examples:
    * `[B1.body, B2.body, ..., Bn.body]` -- entire requested range is filled with block bodies,
    * `[null, null, B3.body, ..., Bn.body]` -- first two blocks are unavailable (either pruned or not yet downloaded),
    * `[null, null, ..., null]` -- requested range is behind the latest known block and all blocks are unavailable,
    * `[B1.body, B2.body, B3.body, B4.body]` -- `B4` is the latest known block and trailing `null` values are trimmed,
    * `[]` -- entire requested range is beyond the latest known block,
    * `[null, null, B3.body, B4.body]` -- first two blocks are unavailable, `B4` is the latest known block.

1. Client software **MUST** set `withdrawals` field to `null` for bodies of pre-Shanghai blocks.

1. This request maps to [`BeaconBlocksByRange`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#beaconblocksbyrange) in the consensus layer `p2p` specification.

1. Callers must be careful to not confuse `start` with a slot number, instead mapping the slot to a block number. Callers must also be careful to request non-finalized blocks by hash in order to avoid race conditions around the current view of the canonical chain.

1. Callers must be careful to verify the hash of the received blocks when requesting non-finalized parts of the chain since the response is prone to being re-orged.

1. Callers must consider that syncing execution layer client may not serve any block bodies, including those that were supplied by `engine_newPayload` calls.
