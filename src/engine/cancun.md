- `excessBlobGas`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits

### BlobsBundleV1

The fields are encoded as follows:

- `commitments`: `Array of DATA` - Array of `KZGCommitment` as defined in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), 48 bytes each (`DATA`).

- `blobs`: `Array of DATA` - Array of blobs, each blob is `FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB * BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT = 4096 * 32 = 131072` bytes (`DATA`) representing a SSZ-encoded `Blob` as defined in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)

All of the above three arrays **MUST** be of same length.

### BlobAndProofV1

The fields are encoded as follows:

- `blob`: `DATA` - `FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB * BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT = 4096 * 32 = 131072` bytes (`DATA`) representing a SSZ-encoded `Blob` as defined in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844).

## Methods

### engine_newPayloadV3

#### Request

* method: `engine_newPayloadV3`
* params:
  1. `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV3`](#ExecutionPayloadV3).
  2. `expectedBlobVersionedHashes`: `Array of DATA`, 32 Bytes - Array of expected blob versioned hashes to validate.
  3. `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Root of the parent beacon block.

#### Response

Refer to the response for [`engine_newPayloadV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_newpayloadv2).

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_newPayloadV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_newpayloadv2) with the addition of the following:

1. Client software **MUST** check that provided set of parameters and their fields strictly matches the expected one and return `-32602: Invalid params` error if this check fails. Any field having `null` value **MUST** be considered as not provided.

2. Client software **MUST** return `-38005: Unsupported fork` error if the `timestamp` of the payload does not fall within the time frame of the Cancun fork.

3. Given the expected array of blob versioned hashes client software **MUST** run its validation by taking the following steps:
    1. Obtain the actual array by concatenating blob versioned hashes lists (`tx.blob_versioned_hashes`) of each [blob transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#new-transaction-type) included in the payload, respecting the order of inclusion. If the payload has no blob transactions the expected array **MUST** be `[]`.
    2. Return `{status: INVALID, latestValidHash: null, validationError: errorMessage | null}` if the expected and the actual arrays don't match.

    This validation **MUST** be instantly run in all cases even during active sync process.

### engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3

#### Request

* method: `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`
* params:
  1. `forkchoiceState`: [`ForkchoiceStateV1`](./paris.md#ForkchoiceStateV1).
  2. `payloadAttributes`: `Object|null` - Instance of [`PayloadAttributesV3`](#payloadattributesv3) or `null`.
* timeout: 8s

#### Response

Refer to the response for [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv2).

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv2) with the following changes to the processing flow:

1. Client software **MUST** verify that `forkchoiceState` matches the [`ForkchoiceStateV1`](./paris.md#ForkchoiceStateV1) structure and return `-32602: Invalid params` on failure.

2. Extend point (7) of the `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` [specification](./paris.md#specification-1) by defining the following sequence of checks that **MUST** be run over `payloadAttributes`:

    1. `payloadAttributes` matches the [`PayloadAttributesV3`](#payloadattributesv3) structure, return `-38003: Invalid payload attributes` on failure.

    2. `payloadAttributes.timestamp` falls within the time frame of the Cancun fork, return `-38005: Unsupported fork` on failure.

    3. `payloadAttributes.timestamp` is greater than `timestamp` of a block referenced by `forkchoiceState.headBlockHash`, return `-38003: Invalid payload attributes` on failure.

    4. If any of the above checks fails, the `forkchoiceState` update **MUST NOT** be rolled back.

### engine_getPayloadV3

The response of this method is extended with [`BlobsBundleV1`](#blobsbundlev1) containing the blobs, their respective KZG commitments
and proofs corresponding to the `versioned_hashes` included in the blob transactions of the execution payload.

#### Request

* method: `engine_getPayloadV3`
* params:
  1. `payloadId`: `DATA`, 8 Bytes - Identifier of the payload build process
* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `object`
  - `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV3`](#ExecutionPayloadV3)
  - `blockValue` : `QUANTITY`, 256 Bits - The expected value to be received by the `feeRecipient` in wei
  - `blobsBundle`: [`BlobsBundleV1`](#BlobsBundleV1) - Bundle with data corresponding to blob transactions included into `executionPayload`
  - `shouldOverrideBuilder` : `BOOLEAN` - Suggestion from the execution layer to use this `executionPayload` instead of an externally provided one
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the payload.

#### Specification

Refer to the specification for [`engine_getPayloadV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_getpayloadv2) with addition of the following:

1. Client software **MUST** return `-38005: Unsupported fork` error if the `timestamp` of the built payload does not fall within the time frame of the Cancun fork.

2. The call **MUST** return `blobsBundle` with empty `blobs`, `commitments` and `proofs` if the payload doesn't contain any blob transactions.

3. The call **MUST** return `commitments` matching the versioned hashes of the transactions list of the execution payload, in the same order,
   i.e. `assert verify_kzg_commitments_against_transactions(payload.transactions, blobsBundle.commitments)` (see EIP-4844 consensus-specs).

4. The call **MUST** return `blobs` and `proofs` that match the `commitments` list, i.e. `assert len(blobsBundle.commitments) == len(blobsBundle.blobs) == len(blobsBundle.proofs)` and `assert verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch(blobsBundle.blobs, blobsBundle.commitments, blobsBundle.proofs)`.

5. Client software **MAY** use any heuristics to decide whether to set `shouldOverrideBuilder` flag or not. If client software does not implement any heuristic this flag **SHOULD** be set to `false`.

### engine_getBlobsV1

Consensus layer clients **MAY** use this method to fetch blobs from the execution layer blob pool.

*Note*: This is a new optional method introduced after Cancun. It is defined here because it is backwards-compatible with Cancun.

#### Request

* method: `engine_getBlobsV1`
* params:
  1. `Array of DATA`, 32 Bytes - Array of blob versioned hashes.
* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `Array of BlobAndProofV1` - Array of [`BlobAndProofV1`](#BlobAndProofV1), items of which may be `null`.
* error: code and message set in case an error occurs during processing of the request.

#### Specification

1. Given an array of blob versioned hashes client software **MUST** respond with an array of `BlobAndProofV1` objects with matching versioned hashes, respecting the order of versioned hashes in the input array.

1. Client software **MUST** place responses in the order given in the request, using `null` for any missing blobs. For instance, if the request is `[A_versioned_hash, B_versioned_hash, C_versioned_hash]` and client software has data for blobs `A` and `C`, but doesn't have data for `B`, the response **MUST** be `[A, null, C]`.

1. Client software **MUST** support request sizes of at least 128 blob versioned hashes. The client **MUST** return `-38004: Too large request` error if the number of requested blobs is too large.

1. Client software **MAY** return an array of all `null` entries if syncing or otherwise unable to serve blob pool data.

1. Callers **MUST** consider that execution layer clients may prune old blobs from their pool, and will respond with `null` if a blob has been pruned.

### Deprecate `engine_exchangeTransitionConfigurationV1`

This document introduces deprecation of [`engine_exchangeTransitionConfigurationV1`](./paris.md#engine_exchangetransitionconfigurationv1). The deprecation is specified as follows:

1. Consensus layer clients **MUST NOT** call this method.

2. Execution layer clients **MUST NOT** surface an error message to the user if this method is not called.

3. Consensus and execution layer clients **MAY** remove support of this method after Cancun. If no longer supported, this method **MUST** be removed from the [`engine_exchangeCapabilities`](./common.md#engine_exchangecapabilities) request or response list depending on whether it is consensus or execution layer client.

### Update the methods of previous forks

This document defines how Cancun payload should be handled by the [`Shanghai API`](./shanghai.md).

For the following methods:

- [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv2)
- [`engine_newPayloadV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_newpayloadV2)
- [`engine_getPayloadV2`](./shanghai.md#engine_getpayloadv2)

a validation **MUST** be added:

1. Client software **MUST** return `-38005: Unsupported fork` error if the `timestamp` of payload or payloadAttributes greater or equal to the Cancun activation timestamp.
