  description: '`earliest`: The lowest numbered block the client has available; `finalized`: The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination; `safe`: The most recent block that is safe from re-orgs under honest majority and certain synchronicity assumptions; `latest`: The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions; `pending`: A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Before the merge transition is finalized, any call querying for `finalized` or `safe` block MUST be responded to with `-39001: Unknown block` error'
