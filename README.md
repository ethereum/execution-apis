# Execution API Specification

## JSON-RPC

[View the spec][playground]

The Ethereum JSON-RPC is a standard collection of methods that all execution
clients implement. It is the canonical interface between users and the network.
This interface allows downstream tooling and infrastructure to treat different
Ethereum clients as modules that can be swapped at will.

### Contributing

Please see the contributors guide in [`docs/making-changes.md`][making-changes]
for general information about the process of standardizing new API methods and
making changes to existing ones. Information on test generation can be found
in [`tests/README.md`][test-gen]

The specification itself is written in [OpenRPC][openrpc]. Refer to the OpenRPC
specification and the JSON schema [specification][json-schema] to get started.

### Building

The specification is split into multiple files to improve readability. The 
spec can be compiled into a single document as follows:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
Build successful.
```

This will output the file `openrpc.json` in the root of the project. This file
will have all schema `#ref`s resolved.

#### Testing

There are several mechanisms for testing specification contributions and client
conformance. 

First is the [OpenRPC validator][validator]. It performs some basic syntactic
checks on the generated specification.

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run lint
OpenRPC spec validated successfully.
```

Next is `speccheck`. This tool validates the test cases in the `tests`
directory against the specification.

```console
$ go install github.com/lightclient/rpctestgen/cmd/speccheck@latest
$ speccheck -v
all passing.
```

The spell checker ensures the specification is free of spelling errors.

```console
$ pip install pyspelling
$ pyspelling -c spellcheck.yaml
Spelling check passed :)
```

Finally, the test cases in the `tests/` directory may be run against individual
execution client using the [`hive`] simulator [`rpc-compat`][rpc-compat].
Please see the documentation in the aforementioned repositories for more
information.

## GraphQL

[View the spec][graphql-schema]

[EIP-1767][eip-1767] proposed a GraphQL schema for interacting with Ethereum clients. Since then Besu and Geth have implemented the interface. This repo contains a live specification to integrate changes to the protocol as well as other improvements into the GraphQL schema.

### Generation

The schema in this repo is generated by issuing a meta GraphQL query against a live node. This can be done as follows:

```console
$ npm run graphql:schema
```

### Testing

A script is included in the source code which reads and validates the given schema to be a valid one. It is recommended to perform this check after modifying the schema by:

```console
$ npm run graphql:validate
```
