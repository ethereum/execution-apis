## Constants

| Name | Value |
| - | - |
| `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST` |  `uint64(8192) = 2**13` |

## Structures

### PayloadAttributesV5

This structure has the syntax of [`PayloadAttributesV4`](./amsterdam.md#payloadattributesv4) and appends a single field: `inclusionListTransactions`.

- `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits - value for the `timestamp` field of the new payload
- `prevRandao`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - value for the `prevRandao` field of the new payload
- `suggestedFeeRecipient`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - suggested value for the `feeRecipient` field of the new payload
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.
- `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Root of the parent beacon block.
- `slotNumber`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits - value for the `slotNumber` field of the new payload
- `targetGasLimit`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits - target value for the `gasLimit` field of the new payload
- `inclusionListTransactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718).

### PayloadStatusV2

This structure has the syntax of `PayloadStatusV1` and appends a single field: `latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash`

- `status`: `enum` - `"VALID" | "INVALID" | "SYNCING" | "ACCEPTED"`
- `latestValidHash`: `DATA|null`, 32 Bytes - the hash of the most recent *valid* block in the branch defined by payload and its ancestors
- `validationError`: `String|null` - a message providing additional details on the validation error if the payload is classified as `INVALID`.
- `latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash`: `DATA|null`, 32 Bytes - the hash of the most recent block that *satisfied the inclusion list constraints* in the branch defined by payload and its ancestors

*Note:* `latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash` does not imply that all its ancestors have satisfied the inclusion list constraints.

## Routines

### Payload validation

This routine follows the same specification as [Payload validation](./paris.md#payload-validation) with the following changes to the processing flow:

1. Extend point (3) of the [Payload validation](./paris.md#payload-validation) by defining the additional response field that **MUST** be returned by the validation process:

    1. The response **MUST** contain `{latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash: satisfiedHash}` where `satisfiedHash` **MUST** be:
      - The block hash of the most recent valid block in the branch defined by the payload and its ancestors for which payload validation satisfied the inclusion list constraints with respect to the corresponding `inclusionListTransactions` as defined in [EIP-7805](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805).

    2. Inclusion list satisfaction **MUST** be determined only for payloads deemed `VALID`.

2. Extend point (4) of the [Payload validation](./paris.md#payload-validation) by defining the idempotency of inclusion list satisfaction:

    1. Whether a payload satisfies the inclusion list constraints **MAY** change between validations when different `inclusionListTransactions` are provided. The value of `latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash` **MAY** change accordingly.

### Payload building

This routine follows the same specification as [Payload building](./paris.md#payload-building) with the following changes to the processing flow:

1. Client software **MUST** take `inclusionListTransactions` into account during the payload build process. The built `ExecutionPayload` **MUST** satisfy the inclusion list constraints with respect to `inclusionListTransactions` as defined in [EIP-7805](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805).

## Methods

### engine_newPayloadV6

Method parameter list is extended with `inclusionListTransactions`.

#### Request

* method: `engine_newPayloadV6`
* params:
  1. `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV4`](./amsterdam.md#executionpayloadv4).
  2. `expectedBlobVersionedHashes`: `Array of DATA`, 32 Bytes - Array of expected blob versioned hashes to validate.
  3. `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Root of the parent beacon block.
  4. `executionRequests`: `Array of DATA` - List of execution layer triggered requests. Each list element is a `requests` byte array as defined by [EIP-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685). The first byte of each element is the `request_type` and the remaining bytes are the `request_data`. Elements of the list **MUST** be ordered by `request_type` in ascending order. Elements with empty `request_data` **MUST** be excluded from the list.
  5. `inclusionListTransactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718).

#### Response

* result: [`PayloadStatusV2`](#payloadstatusv2)
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while processing the payload.

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_newPayloadV5`](./amsterdam.md#engine_newpayloadv5) with the following changes:

1. Client software **MUST** return `-38005: Unsupported fork` error if the `timestamp` of the payload does not fall within the time frame of the Bogota fork.

2. Client software **MUST** store `inclusionListTransactions` for a payload with `ACCEPTED` status. Client software **MUST** use the stored `inclusionListTransactions` when the payload is later validated.

3. Client software **MUST** set `latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash` to `null` when returning a payload status not obtained from the [Payload validation](#payload-validation) process.

### engine_getInclusionListV1

#### Request

* method: `engine_getInclusionListV1`
* params:
  1. `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - block hash of the block upon which the inclusion list should be built.

* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718).
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the inclusion list.

#### Specification

1. Client software **MUST** return `-38001: Unknown payload` error if a block with the given `blockHash` does not exist.

2. Client software **MUST** provide a list of transactions for the inclusion list based on the local view of the mempool. The strategy for selecting which transactions to include is implementation dependent.

3. Client software **MUST** ensure the byte length of the RLP encoding of the returned transaction list does not exceed `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST`.

4. Client software **MUST NOT** include any [blob transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#blob-transaction) in the returned transaction list.
 
### engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV5

#### Request

* method: `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV5`
* params:
  1. `forkchoiceState`: [`ForkchoiceStateV1`](./paris.md#forkchoicestatev1).
  2. `payloadAttributes`: `Object|null` - Instance of [`PayloadAttributesV5`](#payloadattributesv5) or `null`.
  3. `custodyColumns`: `DATA|null`, 16 Bytes - Interpreted as a bitarray of length `CELLS_PER_EXT_BLOB` indicating which column indices form the CL's custody set, or `null` if the CL does not provide custody services.
* timeout: 8s

#### Response

* result: `object`
  - `payloadStatus`: [`PayloadStatusV2`](#payloadstatusv2), with the same `status` value restrictions as [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4`](./amsterdam.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv4).
  - `payloadId`: `DATA|null`, 8 Bytes - identifier of the payload build process or `null`
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while the validating payload, updating the forkchoice or initiating the payload build process.

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4`](./amsterdam.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv4) with the following changes to the processing flow:

1. Extend point (8) of the `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` [specification](./paris.md#specification-1) by defining the following sequence of checks that **MUST** be run over `payloadAttributes`:

    1. `payloadAttributes` matches the [`PayloadAttributesV5`](#payloadattributesv5) structure, return `-38003: Invalid payload attributes` on failure.

    2. `payloadAttributes.timestamp` does not fall within the time frame of the Bogota fork, return `-38005: Unsupported fork` on failure.

2. Extend point (9) of the `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` [specification](./paris.md#specification-1) by defining `payloadStatus.latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash`:

    1. If `payloadStatus.latestValidHash` is the hash of a valid payload, `payloadStatus.latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash` **MUST** be the block hash of the most recent valid block in the branch defined by `payloadStatus.latestValidHash` and its ancestors for which payload validation satisfied the inclusion list constraints with respect to the corresponding `inclusionListTransactions` as defined in [EIP-7805](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805).

    2. Otherwise, `payloadStatus.latestInclusionListSatisfiedHash` **MUST** be `null`.

### Update the methods of previous forks

#### Amsterdam API

For the following methods:

- [`engine_newPayloadV5`](./amsterdam.md#engine_newpayloadv5)
- [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4`](./amsterdam.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv4)

a validation **MUST** be added:

1. Client software **MUST** return `-38005: Unsupported fork` error if the `timestamp` of payload is greater than or equal to the Bogota activation timestamp.
