# Engine JSON-RPC API

The Engine JSON-RPC API is a collection of methods that all execution clients implement.
This interface allows the communication between consensus and execution layers of the two-component post-Merge Ethereum Client.

This API is in *active development* and currently specified in markdown documents specified by fork scopes ([Paris](./paris.md), [Shanghai](./shanghai.md), [Cancun](./cancun.md), [Prague](./prague.md)).
